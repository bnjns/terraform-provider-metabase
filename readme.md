A Terraform provider that lets you manage your Metabase instance, because why not Terraform the world?
</div>

## üßê About

_TODO_

## üèÅ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) >= 1.0
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) >= 1.17

For local development, you may also want one of:
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- Java Runtime Environment >= 1.8

### Installing

Simply clone this repo to your desired location:

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:bnjns/terraform-provider-metabase.git
```

Install the Go dependencies:

```sh
$ go mod download
```

## üéà Usage

### Building the provider

To build the provider and install into your `GOPATH`:

```sh
$ go install
```

### Configuring Terraform

You can configure Terraform to use a [local build](#building-the-provider) by adding the following to you `~/.terraformrc` file:

```hcl
provider_installation {
  dev_overrides {
    "bnjns/metabase" = "</path/to/GOPATH>/bin"
  }

  direct {}
}
```

> **Note:** You must include `direct {}` otherwise all other providers will fail to install.

### Running Metabase

It is recommended that you run a local copy of Metabase to test against when developing, and inspect the API. You can
either use Docker to run Metabase or run it manually.

Once Metabase is started, you'll need to navigate to `http://localhost:3000` and configure Super User. Make sure you
remember the username (email) and password so that you can configure the provider when testing.

#### Using Docker

Simply use the included [`docker`](docker) set-up to run Metabase:

```sh
$ cd docker && \
    docker-compose up metabase
```

This will start Metabase on port 3000.

This also includes a selection of other databases, which you can use to experiment with. To start the entire network:

```sh
$ docker-compose up
```

#### Running Metabase manually

[Download the JAR](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/operations-guide/running-the-metabase-jar-file.html) to a
sensible location and run:

```sh
$ java \
    -DMB_PASSWORD_COMPLEXITY=weak \
    -DMB_SEND_EMAIL_ON_FIRST_LOGIN_FROM_NEW_DEVICE='false' \
    -jar metabase.jar
```

This will start Metabase on port 3000.

### Generating the documentation

The documentation can be auto-generated using `tfplugindocs`:

```sh
go generate
```

### Running the tests
